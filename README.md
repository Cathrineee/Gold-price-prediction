## Introduction

This is the final group project for the Fall 2022 [STAT 443](https://uwflow.com/course/stat443) course at the [University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca), taught by Professor Reza Ramezan.

We analyzed the monthly gold price in CHF from 1979 to 2021 and try to use regression models, smoothing methods, and box-jenkins models to fit the data and make predictions. See the [report]((presentation/report.pdf)) for more background and details.
